## Challenge Results Explanation

### Understanding Your Score

Below is a general explanation of the different scores you may see in the rankings (for a detailed explanation, please refer to the [challenge rules](docs/es_challenge_rules.pdf)):

#### Positive Score

A positive score indicates successful submissions that produced valid solutions, although there may be some instances that produced invalid solutions or errors.

#### Zero Score

Teams with a score of 0 could have encountered one or more of the following issues:

- **Compilation Success, no valid solutions**: your code compiled successfully, but no solutions met the feasibility criteria across any test cases.
- **Timeouts**: your program successfully compiled but exceeded the time limit (600 seconds) on the test instances.
- **Empty output files**: your program ran but produced empty output files or failed to generate any output.
- **Invalid Format**: your outputs did not follow the required format and could not be processed by the evaluation system.

#### Negative Score

Teams with a negative score typically encountered:

- **Compilation errors**: the submitted code failed to compile using the standard Maven build process. Common causes include:
    - Incompatible Java or library (e.g., CPLEX or OR-Tools) versions
    - Missing files or classes
    - Syntax errors
    - References to libraries that weren't included in the submission
    - Dependency issues

- **Runtime errors**: the program compiled but encountered errors during execution, such as:
    - Null pointer exceptions
    - Array index out of bounds
    - Class not found exceptions
    - Other runtime exceptions

## Project Structure

- `src/main/java/org/sbpo2025/challenge`
  - `Challenge.java` ⟶ Main Java class for reading an input, solving the challenge, and writing the output.
  - `ChallengeSolver.java` ⟶ Java class responsible for solving the wave order picking problem. Most of the solving logic should be implemented here.
  - `ChallengeSolution.java` ⟶ Java class representing the solution to the wave order picking problem.
- `datasets/` ⟶ Directory containing input instance files.
  - `a/` ⟶ Dataset A with 20 instances.
  - `b/` ⟶ Dataset B with 15 instances.
  - `x/` ⟶ Dataset X with 15 instances.
- `run_challenge.py` ⟶ Python script to compile code, run benchmarks, and evaluate solutions.
- `checker.py` ⟶ Python script for evaluating the feasibility and objective value of solutions.

## Prerequisites

- Java 17
- Maven
- Python 3.8 or higher
- CPLEX 22.11 (optional)
- OR-Tools 9.11 (optional)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mercadolibre/challenge-sbpo-2025
    ```
2. Set the paths to CPLEX and OR-Tools libraries in `run_challenge.py` if needed, e.g.:
    ```sh
    cplex_path = "$HOME/CPLEX_Studio2211/opl/bin/arm64_osx/"
    or_tools_path = "$HOME/Documents/or-tools/build/lib/"
    ```

## Usage

### Running the challenge

To compile the code and run benchmarks, use the following command:
```sh
python run_challenge.py <source_folder> <input_folder> <output_folder>
```
Where `<source_folder>` is the path to the Java source code, more specifically, where the `pom.xml` file is located.

In order to run this script you will need the `timeout` (or `gtimeout` on macOS) command installed. You can install it using `apt-get install coreutils` (or equivalent) on Linux or `brew install coreutils` on macOS.

### Checking solution viability

To check the feasibility and objective value of a solution, use the following command:
```sh
python checker.py <input_file> <solution_file>
```

## Examples

1. Compile and run benchmarks:
    ```sh
    python run_challenge.py src/main/java/org/sbpo2025/challenge src/main/resources/instances output
    ```
   
2. Check solution viability:
    ```sh
    python checker.py src/main/resources/instances/instance_001.txt output/instance_001.txt
    ```
